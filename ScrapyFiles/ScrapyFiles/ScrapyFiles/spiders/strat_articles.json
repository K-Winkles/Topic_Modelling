Talented Filipinos once driven overseas by their country\u2019s stagnation are beginning to return in greater numbers, raising hopes that the \u201cbrain drain\u201d that has stunted development may finally be going into reverse. Political stability and economic growth\u2014averaging 6.2% between 2010 and 2015, second only to China\u2019s among East Asia\u2019s major economies\u2014are changing perceptions among the Philippines\u2019 diaspora.President Benigno Aquino III recently said the number of overseas Filipinos may be as low as 9.4 million, and cited the decline as one of his administration\u2019s main achievements.\u201cA lot of people were turned off by the previous administration and all the stories of corruption\u2014the country had an image crisis,\u201d said Mr. Oriel, referring to the years before Mr. Aquino became president in 2010. \u201cBut now a lot of these people are seeing the Philippines as somewhere they can seriously think about going back to.\u201dPaco Sandejas was at Stanford University in the 1990s when he founded the Brain Gain Network, a community of overseas Filipino technology professionals he hoped would work together to counter the so-called brain drain, or the emigration of highly qualified Filipinos.\u201cWe didn\u2019t attract much interest\u201d at the time, Mr. Sandejas said. \u201cMany just said, \u2018Why would I want to do that? The Philippines is such a mess.\u2019 But now the tide has turned, there are many people coming back.\u201dAnd some are coming back to establish startups or take senior executive roles at existing companies, bringing a new dynamism to the economy.Today Mr. Sandejas runs Narra Venture Capital, one of several venture-capital firms in Manila\u2019s nascent startup scene. The Brain Gain Network\u2014which connects Filipino expENLARGatriates with one another and with potential employers in the Philippines\u2014has grown to 2,500 individuals.Nearly half of the Filipinos abroad are thought to have settled overseas permanently, according to the Commission on Filipinos Overseas.

{"title": ["Marketing Fundamentals Every Startup Should Know"], "body": "Marketing is vital in every business, and most absolutely for startup businesses. Even from the start, marketing should be part of any business. It is a must for startups to know marketing fundamentals to ensure that right path would be taken towards growth and success.Second, the concept of value must be emphasized. Startups must realize the true value of what they offer. It is essential to have a mindset that the products and services of a start up business are actually providing help to the customers, that it is trying to solve a particular customer problem. There is a need for startups to systematically communicate the value to their target market. It would attract potential customers and upon winning over them and delivering the value, it would lead to customer satisfaction. Third, after identifying appropriately the market and value of startups, there must be understanding of different channels for the actual execution of marketing strategies. Channels refer to the means by which a customer intends to come in a business. It could either be via social, mobile, landing pages, call center and storefront. Startup entrepreneurs and marketers should know how to utilize them and then determine the right mix of which would work for them. But today, since it is an era wherein everything revolves around technology and Internet, investing in digital marketing must be considered by startups especially consumers around the world are now getting tech-savvy. It is a must for startups to build their presence in various digital platforms. Startups should also take advantage of using social media as means of marketing. For the past few years, there is an increasing amount of social media users with the popular social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to name a few. Digital marketing is a cost-effective and in trend means of marketing that startups should try on. \u00a0Fourth, metrics must be set up to measure marketing efforts. Effective measurement is important as it allows the organization to evaluate what it has been doing and learn in order to make better decisions in the future. The metrics must include specific key result areas and performance indicators to track the effectiveness and efficiency of the marketing campaigns. This would also be helpful in providing insights for ongoing marketing implementations. Overall, by recognizing marketing fundamentals, startups would have a roadmap that would enable them to compete in the challenging world of business. As technology and Internet have been continuously growing and scaling faster, startups should be able to adapt and implement marketing strategies that would lead them to the achievement of their goals.

{"title": ["Factors to consider when choosing a mobile platform \u00a0"], "body": "There are things that you need to consider before choosing or building a business mobile application. If you are involved in business, it is extremely important to choose a mobile platform that works the best for your business. Remember that the market is getting bigger and bigger. People are getting more particular at what types of apps they want. If you want them to use your apps, choose something that will meet their needs. Here are factors to consider when choosing a mobile platformIt takes a lot of time to properly develop applications suitable for mobile phones. The structure that you will intend to create will be according to what you need or want. Since your goal is to make money from your apps or make available a free app to your users that provides them with good value, make sure that you choose something that will please your future customers. You also have to look into the budget of your users as well as their other requirements in choosing an app. One of the greatest thing about using mobile apps is that you can implement an upgrade without spending as much as renovating a building or training new employees.Money does matter when you build smartphone apps. You may have to spend on mobile app development software or pay an expert. Before you make the final decision, analyze your current condition with your customers. If you think you know them well and you have figured out their actual needs and wants, then you can proceed with building an app that is suitable for them. Your app must not only benefit your clients, but your own business as well. Make sure it is enhancing certain processes; otherwise, you are just wasting your money and effort.If you want to gain more users of your apps, updates are necessary. Every new content, feature and function will provide users with more advantages; thus, making them appreciate your mobile apps even more. Updating apps take time. You need to be patient and to allocate enough time in generating the upgrade. You have to be more than willing to devote adequate time especially if you are offering not just a single type of mobile apps.If your customers are using their mobiles or smartphones to locate directions, stores, restaurants, shopping centers and other things, then you may have to build mobile apps that carry this particular function. A mobile app that allows an easier and more convenient searching would definitely please your future clients. When you have apps that cater to every need of your customer, you will be able to deliver customer service at a higher level.While you consider all those things mentioned above, don\u2019t forget to incorporate entertainment and fun. Don\u2019t be too serious; otherwise, your mobile apps will end up looking dull and boring. Build smart apps that are unique. Create those that useful and fun to use at the same time.

Its GDP advanced 1.8 percent quarter-on-quarter in the June quarter of 2016, accelerating from an upwardly revised 1.3 percent expansion reported in the previous three months and in line with market expectations.In 2014, economic growth in the Philippines was strong, driven by strong foreign direct investment and expansion in the real estate, business process outsourcing (BPO) and mining sectors. The World Bank estimates growth of 6.7 percent in 2015.\u00a0One of the main factors international clients outsource to the Philippines is the highly educated labor force. The country produces 450,000 or more graduates a year that are included in the qualified labor pool. The 95% literacy rate shows the country\u2019s efforts to prioritize higher education.\u00a0Their culture is Western-oriented and many of them have studied or worked in the US or being taught to speak with an American accent at school.On freelance marketplaces such as oDesk and Elance, Philippines is the third largest country represented.

She mentioned the techniques and tools used in Agile methodology and conducted an activity that exhibits the significance of project requirements.Testing in Agile teams seems to be largely misunderstood. Some testers think that it is all about test automation. But is it all about test automation? And why does testing usually happen in the end? Yes, with agile teams, testers are involved much earlier in the life cycle (and programmers apply TDD practices). But still, testers cannot do any testing until some amount of software is developed. Can testers really help drive the development of the team?User stories are the most commonly used approach to gathering requirements. But where are the details? When and how are acceptance criteria written? Where do analysis fit in? The details can sometimes be ambiguous, confusing, or even inconsistent.

{"title": ["JavaScript: Why Should We Learn It"], "body": "Let\u2019s start off with the fact that there\u2019s a good chance that you are using a website powered by Javascript on a daily basis. Be it a modern website or not, most websites have at least a minimal trace of Javascript within its code.Javascript has been widely used on software development projects for more than twenty years. In 23 years, it has evolved from a simple scripting language to a game-changing programming language, thanks to the demand of modernization for most web applications. While it may be one of the oldest programming language around, it has been one of the most stable programming language that ever existed.Existing for two decades easily made the scripting language one of the most popular programming languages, according to the TIOBE Programming Community Index (). In fact, Javascript is the #1 most used programming language according to the 2016 Github programming language survey. It owes its popularity as a de facto language for web applications.Do not be mistaken that Javascript is only for web! Javascript also has frameworks for mobile applications development. Recent innovation to the language gave birth to perhaps one of Javascript\u2019s most popular cross-platform runtime environment such as Node.js. Node.js uses a software engine called V8 Engine which allowed Javascript to be used as a middleware, and to access even native machine code.The modern JS environment is massive and can easily overwhelm the untrained with so many choices. This article will help you jumpstart by giving you a shortlist of the most recent, stable libraries that you can start using.You can use AngularJS (link), React (link), or Vue.js (link) as a front-end framework.If you need Javascript for your back-end server, you have either Express.js or Sails.js frameworks available as your REST API servers.Database requirements? You can use MongoDB for a NoSQL database or Sequelize for your traditional SQL database.Fancy data graphs for your presentation? D3.js or ChartJS will have you covered!Game development? Try Phaser.io for making games from scratch!All these libraries should be a good start for your JS project. Not only you will build your project on top of a solid, well-maintained codebase, you will save yourself from a lot of headaches because these libraries are known to be well-documented and troubleshooting resources are plentiful when you search on Google or StackOverflow.Should you find yourself looking for more libraries for a specific purpose like unit testing or array/object manipulations, check for what you need on either npm (Known as Node Package Manager) or Yarn (Package Manager developed by Facebook Engineers).Starting a single JS project can be very immersive, and in turn, very addictive. There\u2019s always a new library for you to use! To be able to know how the Javascript is doing now and in the future, you can always read on to .One of the benefits of using JS\u00a0frameworks on your projects lie on the fact that all of them are written on Javascript! Yes, it\u2019s not uncommon for JS developers to mix-and-match libraries and frameworks. At the end of the day, you will always surprise yourself with what you can achieve and you would feel very productive as you carry on with your project.Now truly is a great time to be a Javascript developer! But what does it mean for you who looks forward to using Javascript as your primary programming language?It\u2019s going to be a thrilling ride for anyone who wants to write a diverse programming language that has a class of its own together with a lively community. The Javascript community is very much alive, and will remain alive for the years ahead. In a world where everything starts to collaborate, it helps if you understand the language that can help you collaborate on the modern software development field.Reference: Innovate. Deliver.

{"title": ["Front-end V.S. Back-end: One Or The Other"], "body": "Simply put, front-end programmers concern themselves with everything that has to do with the user interface while backend programmers handle the data being passed to and from the user/s. Full stack programmers are those who do both.In this article, I\u2019d like to talk about how, in my opinion, you can\u2019t be a full-stack web developer and be equally skilled at both front-end and backend programming. Many developers can do both but all, if not most, are better at one than the other. At the end of the day, it\u2019s what you find to like doing more or what you\u2019d consider more of your strong suit that really peaks your interest. And we all know that it\u2019s easier to learn something you\u2019re fond of.For one thing, they require the same kind of dedication and practice. I really think it takes focusing on one in particular, building a solid foundation on it and continuously developing that skill set in order to truly excel at it. With the many daily advances in technology nowadays, you can\u2019t possibly keep up-to-date on both. And I\u2019m sure I speak for everyone when I say that it\u2019s difficult to keep a skill you don\u2019t always use. I\u2019ve managed to learn many things through application but have as easily managed to forget them out of practice. Mastering a skill not only takes time but it\u2019s also important to have a strong background or at least the fundamental basics of something before you can advance at it.I, for one, take more of an interest developing the front-end side of a website. As I\u2019ve observed, there are more women front-end web developers than men. I guess it\u2019s because it entails a certain level of patience, consistency and attention to detail. I\u2019m not saying men are less capable but I find that they prefer and are, quite frankly, better at handling the technical aspects of it all, e.g. the structuring of data, the processes and logic, etc..At the same time, you can\u2019t say you\u2019re a good front-end developer if you have no experience with backend programming. As separate as they are, they go hand-in-hand in integration. When you\u2019re working with a team especially, it helps when you more or less have an idea on how each component, whether your responsibility of or not, works. In my experience, for example, because I\u2019ve done both, I know what my backend counterpart needs me to implement in order to help make his/her tasks easier to execute. And that works both ways. It\u2019s a lot easier to work with each other and maintain flexibility and efficiency code-wise when you understand each step of the development process.Then again, there are many frameworks and processors that help make web development a lot easier to learn and do nowadays, i.e. you don\u2019t have to know the rudiments of a certain programming language, sometimes, to be able to use it. I, for example, studied the basics of PHP but can\u2019t confidently say that I know what I know. But because of Laravel, for example, I don\u2019t need to. Actually, if it weren\u2019t for innovations like this, I don\u2019t think I would have been able to catch up on my backend knowhow like I did. Major leaps in new methodologies are made everyday and as much as I\u2019d like to expand my range of skills, I have a hard enough time doing so with my front-end programming.To conclude, I\u2019ve met and worked with different kinds of programmers throughout my years as a professional and though I\u2019ve encountered full-stack developers, they all specialize at either front-end or backend programming. It\u2019s just something I wanted to explore a bit and talk/write about. Both roles are equally important and a lot of people don\u2019t know the difference between the two. Like I said, front-end is more of my thing and as much as I\u2019d like to be called a full-stack developer, it\u2019s easier said than done.References:\nInnovate. Deliver.

{"title": ["Brownbag Session: JavaScript ES6"], "body": "One indicator of a healthy software development company is in its ability to adapt and learn emerging technologies. Being in the software industry is all about knowledge sharing, after all. We never just learn something on our own, let alone we learn of the best practices right from the start.Here in Stratpoint, knowledge sharing is serious business. It\u2019s not only we share knowledge for the sake of just sharing knowledge, but rather we share a collective of validated ideas and experiences among one another in many forms. It can range from simply sharing articles to someone, or via mentorship , and one of our favorites; in the form of brown bag sessions.Brown bag sessions are informal meetings held usually for an hour to discuss about almost anything under the sun. Anyone can share anything ranging from software development process, health and wellness, or financial strategies! The best thing about them is that they can be held anytime and everyone can attend.One of our brown bag sessions recently held is for the JavaScript\u2019s most significant update, ECMAScript 2015, or commonly known in the software development circle as \u201cES6\u201d.The recent brown bag session for ES6 served both as one-part quick brush up to JavaScript developers, and one part primer to everyone who wants to try out JavaScript but never knew where to actually start their learning adventure. The brown bag session was filled with several developers who are also experts in other programming languages like PHP, Java, Swift, and Ruby on Rails.The session discussed about the fundamental changes from the old version of JavaScript to its ES6 counterpart, and some new concepts for the language like Classes and Promises. Also discussed are some handy tricks and best practices when using any of the ES6 features.The goal of the brown bag session is to enable the attendees to branch out to currently popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as React, NodeJS, and AngularJS, using the fundamental knowledge that they have learned from the workshop. And should they choose to join the JavaScript developer ranks, they\u2019re in good company. JavaScript is a multi-year awardee of being the most popular programming language according to the recent survey held by StackOverflow ().Knowing how to code in JavaScript nowadays is a vital knowledge for any developer looking to improve their skillsets. We\u2019ve also published an article about why you should learn JavaScript. <cue \u201cWhy you should learn Javascript\u201d article>.As digital experts, we at Stratpoint make it certain that we\u2019re always one step ahead with emerging technologies. We take knowledge sharing as an art form where the passionate is welcome to share any of their methods or ideas. As such, the brown bag sessions are just one of the catalysts to our competency as a well-rounded software development company here in the Philippines.Innovate. Deliver.

{"title": ["Industrie 4.0 and Higher Education"], "body": "Last\u00a0December 5, 2018, at the ISC Mezzanine Hall, Centro Escolar University (CEU) Manila, Stratpoint\u2019s Chief Technology Innovation Officer, Jay Sabido, Ph.D. was invited to be one of the speakers of CEU\u2019s Management Review to discuss \u201cIndustrie 4.0 and Higher Education\u201d.Industry 4.0 was initially coined by the German government for their high-tech strategy. It has been widely adopted and now refers to the current trend of automation and data exchange. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet Of Things (IoT), cloud computing and cognitive computing. Industry 4.0 is commonly referred to as the fourth industrial revolution.There are some challenges in most traditional learning environments that sometimes cause graduates to face a world of transformed technology unarmed. Some mentioned the need to focus on quality educational experiences, the need to evolve outdated teaching methodologies, the imperative to prepare students to become part of the workforce of the future, skyrocketing operational costs, the need to keep tuition rates down, generation of students who are increasingly tuning-out and turning-off from the traditional approach of age-old instructional methods and a lot more. He also mentioned that customer preferences and expectations are constantly changing.The ever-evolving state of technology has impacted the way that people consume media and communicate with each other. Like \u201cThere must be an app for that\u201d or comparisons like \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be like Apple\u2026or Waze\u2026or Amazon\u2026 or Facebook\u2026or Netflix\u2026 or\u2026\u201dThe solution for these is Digital Transformation. Being digital means having physical products at the core, augmented by digital interfaces and data-based innovative services, working together with customers and suppliers in the industrial digital ecosystem.But it\u2019s not about using technology to do the same things you\u2019ve always done, only faster, cheaper, and better. It\u2019s about using the technology to do things that weren\u2019t possible before \u2013 creating new products and services that drive more revenue.So what role will higher education play in the next phase of this revolution? Why do Digital Transformation and Industry 4.0 matter? How should higher education leaders prepare their institutions for the changes ahead? Shown in the image below is a diagram of the Drivers in Higher Education.A number of alternative education models have emerged over the last decade such as massive open online courses (MOOC), bootcamps, learn now \u2013 pay later education, nanodegrees, and alternative credentialing.There are four key technologies that are driving innovation in the HE sector \u2013 Social, Mobile, Analytics, and Cloud (SMAC). There were at least 45% of College students in the States who have used social media as a learning tool. And about 85% TO 97% of the college students in the states use mobile phones for accessing student services. 81 % uses IoT devices. And US$9 billion HE cloud market size.Jay confidently went over this topic since Stratpoint has its expertise as a Digital Transformation Enabler. Stratpoint employs cutting-edge open source and cloud technologies for the top enterprises and start-ups in the U.S. and the Philippines.Innovate. Deliver.

Inspire.\u00a9 Copyright 1998-2017 Stratpoint Technologies, Inc. All rights reserved.As an active seeker for good books, time and time again whenever there is something to look forward to, a book instantly gets into my stack waiting to be read in the near future. Whether it would be a good one or not, it would be up to the \u201cme\u201d who is at a certain space and time in the future. Whether that unique space, time, and circumstance will happen or not, the highlight to this paragraph is that I was still able to add a new body of knowledge to my stack; be it good or bad, just as academics and researchers aim to contribute to the pool of existing studies and theories. We\u2019ll get to more of that later, but first, hear me out on how I created my first Python package and published it for anyone to use.I have been maintaining and improving a machine learning project that revolves around the Python language for quite some time. I rarely get the issue of actually needing to create a new functionality since there usually is an already existing Python package for it. Other times, even if I do have the need to create something complex, it only fits the use-case we have now.For added context, I dealt with a lot of Node JS code and one of the things that I love with Node JS is the vast amount of packages there is with the amazing NPM (Node Package Manager). It has a very active community that always maintains code and creates new packages for future re-use.Going back to Python, I was looking for a good logging module to better inform developers the various status we could face. Gladly enough, Python has an out-of-the-box option which allows you to log information, errors, and warnings, to name a few. What I felt tedious was enabling a mechanism to log with an available timestamp and better visuals out-of-the-box. \u00a0Unfortunately, no such immediate solution was available. I thought that I probably would be doing this for most of my remaining Python days. And so my journey begins to create a wrapper for Python\u2019s logging module!The structure below will be our basis of how our package files will be arranged. You can have fun with how you populate content for the  and  file. I used the license for my purpose as a good starter. This will make sense later on when we start to publish our package.\u00a0 my-new-logger\n\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0\u00a0logger/\n\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0\u00a0logger.py\n\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0\u00a0__init__.py\n\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0\u00a0test.py\n\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0\u00a0setup.py\n\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0\u00a0README.rst\n\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0\u00a0LICENSE.txtTo start off, I idealized all of this as simple importing of the module I created and returns of the logger with initialized configurations of my liking. So I should first import the module we would be needing for the wrapper.\u00a0 import logging\nAfter that, the very important function definition should be next. With the current logging module of Python, it allows you to input a name for the logger; we\u2019ll add that capability as well to our extended wrapper.\u00a0 defMyLogger(name = None):\nNow we highlight the part where I wanted better visuals for our logger. Fortunately, we can use ASCII color codes to allow this, which would look something like this:  actually makes all text after it turns to color blue.\u00a0 \u00a0MAGENTA\u00a0 =\u00a0 \u2018\\033[95m\u2019\n\u00a0 \u00a0BLUE\u00a0 =\u00a0 \u2018\\033[94m\u2019\n\u00a0 \u00a0GREEN\u00a0 =\u00a0 \u2018\\033[92m\u2019\n\u00a0 \u00a0YELLOW\u00a0 =\u00a0 \u2018\\033[93m\u2019\n\u00a0 \u00a0RED\u00a0 =\u00a0 \u2018\\033[91m\u2019\n\u00a0 \u00a0GREY\u00a0 =\u00a0 \u2018\\033[0m\u2019\n\u00a0 \u00a0WHITE\u00a0 =\u00a0 \u2018\\033[1m\u2019We then integrate these colors into the status we want to stand out.  \u00a0logging.addLevelName(\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0logging.DEBUG,\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018{}{}\\t{}\u2019.format(WHITE, logging.getLevelName(logging.DEBUG), GREY))\n \u00a0logging.addLevelName(\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0logging.INFO,\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018{}{}\\t{}\u2019.format(GREEN, logging.getLevelName(logging.INFO), GREY))\n \u00a0logging.addLevelName(\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0logging.WARNING,\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018{}{}\\t{}\u2019.format(YELLOW, logging.getLevelName(logging.WARNING), GREY))\n \u00a0logging.addLevelName(\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0logging.ERROR,\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018{}{}\\t{}\u2019.format(RED, logging.getLevelName(logging.ERROR), GREY))\n \u00a0logging.addLevelName(\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0logging.CRITICAL,\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018{}{}\\t{}\u2019.format(MAGENTA, logging.getLevelName(logging.CRITICAL), GREY))\nLastly, we put all this together, from the names to the format that we need to be defined above.

I created an account in PyPi for our package to have a container. I\u2019ll leave this all up to you as we have various choices of control systems to use. After that, I installed a very handy-dandy tool called to help us with publishing.\u00a0 pip install twineOnce everything is well and clean, we run the following scripts in order to start the publishing process.\u00a0 python setup.py sdist\n\u00a0 twine upload dist/*\nTo give more context on what\u2019s happening, the first command bundles our package into a compressed file which stores it inside the  folder. The  command uploads that file to . Prepare to input your username and password you created from the previous step.That is how I created and published my first package into  due to my issue of not having good solutions to my problem.As programmers (or with any other tasks that demand repetition), we know how challenging it is when we\u2019re assigned to do something while not having the right tools for it. The normal instinct would be to try and create the tool we need at the current use-case and then leave it there; without the opportunity to improve and be criticized. \u00a0Sure, that is perfectly fine. But isn\u2019t it better to find the pieces of code that can work alone and be published for public use?I am not claiming that the wrapper I created is 100% state-of-the-art and should be the standard. I am not saying that no other package can compete with what I created. In fact, I would be much happier to find, along the way, a package that could fit more of my needs than what I have with my current package. Overall, the mindset should be to improve on what is available now or start a movement to create what is missing; to be able to contribute to the greater population. The journey that I took will be read by a few, who will learn from the mistakes I may have made with the use-case and might find a better way to do all this.The more we contribute, the more the tools we have around us improve. With better tools comes better output to our work. Better output of work entails satisfaction from our customers and the community. Posted in Tagged By using this site, you agree to our updated "}
