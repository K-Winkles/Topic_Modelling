He is in charge of the Intelligence solutions for Highfleet, Inc. & Amberoon Inc. and is currently the Managing Director of Adatos.During his morning session for CIOs, CTOs and CEOs of various companies, Drew talked about Monetizing Big Data.

      "Many don’t have experience in Big DataSome Key Takeaways:One of the most important principles that should be applied to business: The OODA Loop: You have to be fast or you will die. The OODA Loop was developed by military strategist and USAF Colonel John Boyd. The concept was applied to the combat operations process, often at the strategic level in military operations.Data Munging is mundane tedious work but absolutely necessary for analytics. Unless the data is sufficiently clean; you can’t do proper analytics.Business Intelligence and Data Mining only result of an average of 80% ROI; that implies for every $1 dollar spent you only make back 80 cents.On the other hand, understand the root causes and having the capability to build predictive models result in an average 240% ROIIt’s all about ROI. Without solid analytics, you won’t realize ROI from Big Data or Analytic IT investments.Drew’s talk for the second segment uncovered business growth opportunities through data science. It covered how real-time information can be used to make sound business decisions faster, and how to unlock the business potential of stagnant data archives. (ipc.ph)Here’s a summary of Data Science 101:Big Data IT is useless without Analysts doing Analysis. Business Intelligence is generally no better than making graphs from data; there is no analysis involved.Key points:This is an opportunity for Philippines to tool up on this skill set and leapfrog other countries BPO offering to become a world leader in providing Data Scientists.If we don’t learn these skills we may be obsolete within 5-years Innovate.

Set appropriate values for the width and height.Unlike standard views, custom views have no defined intrinsic content size. During design time, Interface Builder doesn’t know what size to expect a custom view to be, so set a placeholder intrinsic content size to indicate the custom view’s content size.If you don’t set a placeholder intrinsic content size, the view may have ambiguous layout constraints.

A bug can be considered as a bug if it deviates from the documented specifications. Upon the detection of a bug a proper report should be done. This presentation discussed some practices that can improve the quality of a bug report. After a bug is reported, it should be monitored using various tracking tools such as scrumboard and online defect management tools.Defect Management also includes the various actions such as bug fixing and defect triage. Defect Triage is a process of  sorting, discussing and assigning bugs done by the PM, QA and Dev.During the presentation, inputs coming from the experiences of both the developers and QA’s fueled several discussions and knowledge sharing.Innovate.

Moreover, HttpClient was deprecated in the last API update (API 22), which means that it will no longer be maintained and may be removed in a future release.\n",
      "These are sufficient reasons for deciding to switch to a more reliable way of handling your network requests.It’s much faster. It caches everything and perfect for small metadata operations.“Retrofit turns your REST API into a Java interface.” It’s an elegant solution for organizing API calls in a project. The request method and relative URL are added with an annotation, which makes code clean and simple.With annotations, you can easily add a request body, manipulate the URL or headers and add query parameters.Adding a return type to a method will make it synchronous, while adding a Callback will allow it to finish asynchronously with success or failure.Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.Picasso is an image library for Android. It’s created and maintained by Square, and caters to image loading and processing. It simplifies the process of displaying images from external locations. In many cases only a few lines of code is required to implement this neat library.Picasso shines for displaying remote images. The library handles every stage of the process, from the initial HTTP request to the caching of the image. This can be quite verbose when writing code to perform these actions yourselfReferences:\n",

I discuss each of these in detail below.This environment is driving three major trends with respect to app functionalities: apps that aggregate and publish content, apps that act like a platform for other apps, and apps that become the collection tool for personalized data. All these are now pushing developers to adopt a new model for app development, one that involves building not just an app, but a “service.” Success with this new model hinges not just on their development skills but, more critically, on their operational capabilities.Read the full article at: Innovate.

      " By Oliver Segovia, via Harvard Business ReviewFifteen years ago, Fort Bonifacio in the Philippines was a former military base still dotted with barracks built in World War II. Thanks to an aggressive privatization and conversion program, Bonifacio Global City — as the base is known today — is a modern, bustling financial district lined with blocks of skyscrapers, shopping malls, and luxury condos.The Southeast Asia city’s rapid growth echoes the story of the so-called  — technology start-ups that rapidly grew to a billion-dollar valuation and beyond. So far, 2015 has . But as start-ups mature, the grow-at-all-cost narrative will be replaced by a flight to capital efficiency and profitability.In this next chapter, the Philippines — the world’s  — will play a crucial role in helping tech companies access the talent to scale efficiently and sustainably.Read the full article at Innovate.

      "OFWs returning to the Philippines \n",
      "\n",
      " An article By Trefor Moss for the Wall Street Journal featuring Paco Sandejas.MANILA—For years Filipinos with professional ambitions knew the surest way to realize them: leave the Philippines.Since the 1970s, Filipinos by the millions have left the country—many for jobs as domestic helpers, chauffeurs and construction workers, but also doctors, academics and tech professionals who saw no prospect of earning a good salary or achieving their career goals at home.But the trend is finally turning. Talented Filipinos once driven overseas by their country’s stagnation are beginning to return in greater numbers, raising hopes that the “brain drain” that has stunted development may finally be going into reverse. Political stability and economic growth—averaging 6.2% between 2010 and 2015, second only to China’s among East Asia’s major economies—are changing perceptions among the Philippines’ diaspora.President Benigno Aquino III recently said the number of overseas Filipinos may be as low as 9.4 million, and cited the decline as one of his administration’s main achievements.“A lot of people were turned off by the previous administration and all the stories of corruption—the country had an image crisis,” said Mr. Oriel, referring to the years before Mr. Aquino became president in 2010. “But now a lot of these people are seeing the Philippines as somewhere they can seriously think about going back to.”Paco Sandejas was at Stanford University in the 1990s when he founded the Brain Gain Network, a community of overseas Filipino technology professionals he hoped would work together to counter the so-called brain drain, or the emigration of highly qualified Filipinos.“We didn’t attract much interest” at the time, Mr. Sandejas said. “Many just said, ‘Why would I want to do that? The Philippines is such a mess.’ But now the tide has turned, there are many people coming back.”And some are coming back to establish startups or take senior executive roles at existing companies, bringing a new dynamism to the economy.Today Mr. Sandejas runs Narra Venture Capital, one of several venture-capital firms in Manila’s nascent startup scene. The Brain Gain Network—which connects Filipino expENLARGatriates with one another and with potential employers in the Philippines—has grown to 2,500 individuals.Nearly half of the Filipinos abroad are thought to have settled overseas permanently, according to the Commission on Filipinos Overseas. But some of them are having a change of heart.Innovate. Deliver. Inspire.© Copyright 1998-2017 Stratpoint Technologies, Inc.

      "Marketing Fundamentals Every Startup Should Know \n",
      "\n",
      " Marketing is vital in every business, and most absolutely for startup businesses. Even from the start, marketing should be part of any business. It is a must for startups to know marketing fundamentals to ensure that right path would be taken towards growth and success.Second, the concept of value must be emphasized. Startups must realize the true value of what they offer. It is essential to have a mindset that the products and services of a start up business are actually providing help to the customers, that it is trying to solve a particular customer problem. There is a need for startups to systematically communicate the value to their target market. It would attract potential customers and upon winning over them and delivering the value, it would lead to customer satisfaction. Third, after identifying appropriately the market and value of startups, there must be understanding of different channels for the actual execution of marketing strategies. Channels refer to the means by which a customer intends to come in a business. It could either be via social, mobile, landing pages, call center and storefront. Startup entrepreneurs and marketers should know how to utilize them and then determine the right mix of which would work for them. But today, since it is an era wherein everything revolves around technology and Internet, investing in digital marketing must be considered by startups especially consumers around the world are now getting tech-savvy. It is a must for startups to build their presence in various digital platforms. Startups should also take advantage of using social media as means of marketing. For the past few years, there is an increasing amount of social media users with the popular social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to name a few. Digital marketing is a cost-effective and in trend means of marketing that startups should try on.  Fourth, metrics must be set up to measure marketing efforts. Effective measurement is important as it allows the organization to evaluate what it has been doing and learn in order to make better decisions in the future. The metrics must include specific key result areas and performance indicators to track the effectiveness and efficiency of the marketing campaigns. This would also be helpful in providing insights for ongoing marketing implementations. Overall, by recognizing marketing fundamentals, startups would have a roadmap that would enable them to compete in the challenging world of business. As technology and Internet have been continuously growing and scaling faster, startups should be able to adapt and implement marketing strategies that would lead them to the achievement of their goals.

      "Factors to consider when choosing a mobile platform   \n",
      "\n",
      " There are things that you need to consider before choosing or building a business mobile application. If you are involved in business, it is extremely important to choose a mobile platform that works the best for your business. Remember that the market is getting bigger and bigger. People are getting more particular at what types of apps they want. If you want them to use your apps, choose something that will meet their needs. Here are factors to consider when choosing a mobile platformIt takes a lot of time to properly develop applications suitable for mobile phones. The structure that you will intend to create will be according to what you need or want. Since your goal is to make money from your apps or make available a free app to your users that provides them with good value, make sure that you choose something that will please your future customers. You also have to look into the budget of your users as well as their other requirements in choosing an app. One of the greatest thing about using mobile apps is that you can implement an upgrade without spending as much as renovating a building or training new employees.Money does matter when you build smartphone apps. You may have to spend on mobile app development software or pay an expert. Before you make the final decision, analyze your current condition with your customers. If you think you know them well and you have figured out their actual needs and wants, then you can proceed with building an app that is suitable for them. Your app must not only benefit your clients, but your own business as well. Make sure it is enhancing certain processes; otherwise, you are just wasting your money and effort.If you want to gain more users of your apps, updates are necessary. Every new content, feature and function will provide users with more advantages; thus, making them appreciate your mobile apps even more. Updating apps take time. You need to be patient and to allocate enough time in generating the upgrade. You have to be more than willing to devote adequate time especially if you are offering not just a single type of mobile apps.If your customers are using their mobiles or smartphones to locate directions, stores, restaurants, shopping centers and other things, then you may have to build mobile apps that carry this particular function. A mobile app that allows an easier and more convenient searching would definitely please your future clients. When you have apps that cater to every need of your customer, you will be able to deliver customer service at a higher level.While you consider all those things mentioned above, don’t forget to incorporate entertainment and fun. Don’t be too serious; otherwise, your mobile apps will end up looking dull and boring. Build smart apps that are unique. Create those that useful and fun to use at the same time. Many users often search for apps that is pleasurable to use.Innovate. Deliver. Inspire.© Copyright 1998-2017 Stratpoint Technologies, Inc.

      "\n",
      " Few years back, Material Design was introduced by Google. However, some of its components were only available to Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or later. Because of this, backward compatibility has been a challenge for developers.Fortunately, with the release of Android Design Support Library, using Material Design’s components has been an easier task. You only need this single dependency:compile ‘com.android.support:design:23.2.0’Here are some of the Material Design visual components:Navigation View is placed within DrawerLayout and displays navigation items from the referenced menu resources. It has two key attributes: headerLayout (optional) and menu.TabLayout is an easier way to put tabs around a ViewPager which acts as sliding tabs between fragments within an app.TextInputLayout allows us to wrap EditText views in order to display floating labels above the EditText field. In addition to showing hints, you can also display an error message below the EditText.Snackbar is shown on the bottom of the screen and contains text with an optional single action. It is also swiped to dismiss. It is used for lightweight and quick feedback about an operation.References:Innovate. Deliver. Inspire.© Copyright 1998-2017 Stratpoint Technologies, Inc.

      "\n",
      "  Here are some of the reasons why the Philippines is being considered as one of the Outsourcing capitals of the world. The Philippines has a status of emerging economy. Its GDP advanced 1.8 percent quarter-on-quarter in the June quarter of 2016, accelerating from an upwardly revised 1.3 percent expansion reported in the previous three months and in line with market expectations.In 2014, economic growth in the Philippines was strong, driven by strong foreign direct investment and expansion in the real estate, business process outsourcing (BPO) and mining sectors. The World Bank estimates growth of 6.7 percent in 2015. One of the main factors international clients outsource to the Philippines is the highly educated labor force. The country produces 450,000 or more graduates a year that are included in the qualified labor pool. The 95% literacy rate shows the country’s efforts to prioritize higher education. Their culture is Western-oriented and many of them have studied or worked in the US or being taught to speak with an American accent at school.On freelance marketplaces such as oDesk and Elance, Philippines is the third largest country represented. According to Forbes, there are approximately 2.3 million Americans registered on these sites, 1.9 million Indians, and 1.3 million Filipinos. For the past 10 years, the Philippine government has been prioritizing and promoting the industry. Government programs provide training for BPO applicants and give investors numerous benefits including tax holidays, tax exemptions, and simplified export and import procedures.The BPO sector is expanding at an average of 20 percent annually. Export revenues from BPO have grown from $1.3 billion in 2004 to $13.3 billion in 2013. IBPAP estimates that the sector generated $15 billion in total revenues in 2013, and expects revenues of $18 billion in 2014, and $25 billion in 2016.  References:Innovate. Deliver.

The company makes it a point to invite doctors from different hospitals every quarter to discuss various disorders, diseases, infections, etc. for employees to have a clearer sense of what’s actually important – their health. Good health leads to better productivity.Yesterday Stratpoint held one of its wellness sessions with Dr. Julius Lizardo, MD, from Santa Ana Hospital. He discussed the causes and effects of hypertension.Some notes from his talk:Hypertension is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated. Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic pressures, which are the maximum and minimum pressures.It contributes to the burden of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure and premature mortality and disability.Hypertension rarely causes symptoms in the early stages and many people go undiagnosed.There are significant health and economic gains attached to early detection, adequate treatment and good control of hypertension.Addressing behavioural risk factors, e.g.\n",
      "unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity, can prevent hypertension.Tobacco use increases the risk of complications of hypertension.Salt reduction initiatives can make a major contribution to prevention and control of high blood pressure.Innovate.

Both parties presented dance and song numbers, it was a pleasure to see all of kids having fun with new-found ates and kuyas for the day.

      "Driving Development With Testing, From User Stories To Executable Specifications \n",
      "\n",
      " Sharing a bunch of learnings from a talk by Lorenzo Dee during the Softcon 2016, Kat Catacutan, Stratpoint QA, discussed the importance of requirements planning and analysis and how it affects the entire project and team. She mentioned the techniques and tools used in Agile methodology and conducted an activity that exhibits the significance of project requirements.Testing in Agile teams seems to be largely misunderstood. Some testers think that it is all about test automation. But is it all about test automation? And why does testing usually happen in the end? Yes, with agile teams, testers are involved much earlier in the life cycle (and programmers apply TDD practices). But still, testers cannot do any testing until some amount of software is developed. Can testers really help drive the development of the team?User stories are the most commonly used approach to gathering requirements. But where are the details? When and how are acceptance criteria written? Where do analysis fit in? The details can sometimes be ambiguous, confusing, or even inconsistent. What techniques can be applied to?This talk shows how testing is an integral part of Agile teams, and how testing guides the team in building the right “it” and not just building “it” right.Innovate.

I need to get more fit to keep up with the requirements of exciting times at Xepto Digital Education.”Other top business leaders who shared their wishes are from Coca-Cola, Citibank, ING Bank, Usana, Xurpas, and Samsung.Read more: Innovate.

      "JavaScript: Why Should We Learn It \n",
      "\n",
      " Let’s start off with the fact that there’s a good chance that you are using a website powered by Javascript on a daily basis. Be it a modern website or not, most websites have at least a minimal trace of Javascript within its code.Javascript has been widely used on software development projects for more than twenty years. In 23 years, it has evolved from a simple scripting language to a game-changing programming language, thanks to the demand of modernization for most web applications. While it may be one of the oldest programming language around, it has been one of the most stable programming language that ever existed.Existing for two decades easily made the scripting language one of the most popular programming languages, according to the TIOBE Programming Community Index (). In fact, Javascript is the #1 most used programming language according to the 2016 Github programming language survey. It owes its popularity as a de facto language for web applications.Do not be mistaken that Javascript is only for web! Javascript also has frameworks for mobile applications development. Recent innovation to the language gave birth to perhaps one of Javascript’s most popular cross-platform runtime environment such as Node.js. Node.js uses a software engine called V8 Engine which allowed Javascript to be used as a middleware, and to access even native machine code.The modern JS environment is massive and can easily overwhelm the untrained with so many choices. This article will help you jumpstart by giving you a shortlist of the most recent, stable libraries that you can start using.You can use AngularJS (link), React (link), or Vue.js (link) as a front-end framework.If you need Javascript for your back-end server, you have either Express.js or Sails.js frameworks available as your REST API servers.Database requirements? You can use MongoDB for a NoSQL database or Sequelize for your traditional SQL database.Fancy data graphs for your presentation? D3.js or ChartJS will have you covered!Game development? Try Phaser.io for making games from scratch!All these libraries should be a good start for your JS project. Not only you will build your project on top of a solid, well-maintained codebase, you will save yourself from a lot of headaches because these libraries are known to be well-documented and troubleshooting resources are plentiful when you search on Google or StackOverflow.Should you find yourself looking for more libraries for a specific purpose like unit testing or array/object manipulations, check for what you need on either npm (Known as Node Package Manager) or Yarn (Package Manager developed by Facebook Engineers).Starting a single JS project can be very immersive, and in turn, very addictive. There’s always a new library for you to use! To be able to know how the Javascript is doing now and in the future, you can always read on to .One of the benefits of using JS frameworks on your projects lie on the fact that all of them are written on Javascript! Yes, it’s not uncommon for JS developers to mix-and-match libraries and frameworks. At the end of the day, you will always surprise yourself with what you can achieve and you would feel very productive as you carry on with your project.Now truly is a great time to be a Javascript developer! But what does it mean for you who looks forward to using Javascript as your primary programming language?It’s going to be a thrilling ride for anyone who wants to write a diverse programming language that has a class of its own together with a lively community. The Javascript community is very much alive, and will remain alive for the years ahead. In a world where everything starts to collaborate, it helps if you understand the language that can help you collaborate on the modern software development field.Reference: Innovate. Deliver.

      "Front-end V.S. Back-end: One Or The Other \n",
      "\n",
      " Simply put, front-end programmers concern themselves with everything that has to do with the user interface while backend programmers handle the data being passed to and from the user/s. Full stack programmers are those who do both.In this article, I’d like to talk about how, in my opinion, you can’t be a full-stack web developer and be equally skilled at both front-end and backend programming. Many developers can do both but all, if not most, are better at one than the other. At the end of the day, it’s what you find to like doing more or what you’d consider more of your strong suit that really peaks your interest. And we all know that it’s easier to learn something you’re fond of.For one thing, they require the same kind of dedication and practice. I really think it takes focusing on one in particular, building a solid foundation on it and continuously developing that skill set in order to truly excel at it. With the many daily advances in technology nowadays, you can’t possibly keep up-to-date on both. And I’m sure I speak for everyone when I say that it’s difficult to keep a skill you don’t always use. I’ve managed to learn many things through application but have as easily managed to forget them out of practice. Mastering a skill not only takes time but it’s also important to have a strong background or at least the fundamental basics of something before you can advance at it.I, for one, take more of an interest developing the front-end side of a website. As I’ve observed, there are more women front-end web developers than men. I guess it’s because it entails a certain level of patience, consistency and attention to detail. I’m not saying men are less capable but I find that they prefer and are, quite frankly, better at handling the technical aspects of it all, e.g. the structuring of data, the processes and logic, etc..At the same time, you can’t say you’re a good front-end developer if you have no experience with backend programming. As separate as they are, they go hand-in-hand in integration. When you’re working with a team especially, it helps when you more or less have an idea on how each component, whether your responsibility of or not, works. In my experience, for example, because I’ve done both, I know what my backend counterpart needs me to implement in order to help make his/her tasks easier to execute. And that works both ways. It’s a lot easier to work with each other and maintain flexibility and efficiency code-wise when you understand each step of the development process.Then again, there are many frameworks and processors that help make web development a lot easier to learn and do nowadays, i.e. you don’t have to know the rudiments of a certain programming language, sometimes, to be able to use it. I, for example, studied the basics of PHP but can’t confidently say that I know what I know. But because of Laravel, for example, I don’t need to. Actually, if it weren’t for innovations like this, I don’t think I would have been able to catch up on my backend knowhow like I did. Major leaps in new methodologies are made everyday and as much as I’d like to expand my range of skills, I have a hard enough time doing so with my front-end programming.To conclude, I’ve met and worked with different kinds of programmers throughout my years as a professional and though I’ve encountered full-stack developers, they all specialize at either front-end or backend programming. It’s just something I wanted to explore a bit and talk/write about. Both roles are equally important and a lot of people don’t know the difference between the two. Like I said, front-end is more of my thing and as much as I’d like to be called a full-stack developer, it’s easier said than done.References:\n",

      "Brownbag Session: JavaScript ES6 \n",
      "\n",
      " One indicator of a healthy software development company is in its ability to adapt and learn emerging technologies. Being in the software industry is all about knowledge sharing, after all. We never just learn something on our own, let alone we learn of the best practices right from the start.Here in Stratpoint, knowledge sharing is serious business. It’s not only we share knowledge for the sake of just sharing knowledge, but rather we share a collective of validated ideas and experiences among one another in many forms. It can range from simply sharing articles to someone, or via mentorship , and one of our favorites; in the form of brown bag sessions.Brown bag sessions are informal meetings held usually for an hour to discuss about almost anything under the sun. Anyone can share anything ranging from software development process, health and wellness, or financial strategies! The best thing about them is that they can be held anytime and everyone can attend.One of our brown bag sessions recently held is for the JavaScript’s most significant update, ECMAScript 2015, or commonly known in the software development circle as “ES6”.The recent brown bag session for ES6 served both as one-part quick brush up to JavaScript developers, and one part primer to everyone who wants to try out JavaScript but never knew where to actually start their learning adventure. The brown bag session was filled with several developers who are also experts in other programming languages like PHP, Java, Swift, and Ruby on Rails.The session discussed about the fundamental changes from the old version of JavaScript to its ES6 counterpart, and some new concepts for the language like Classes and Promises. Also discussed are some handy tricks and best practices when using any of the ES6 features.The goal of the brown bag session is to enable the attendees to branch out to currently popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as React, NodeJS, and AngularJS, using the fundamental knowledge that they have learned from the workshop. And should they choose to join the JavaScript developer ranks, they’re in good company. JavaScript is a multi-year awardee of being the most popular programming language according to the recent survey held by StackOverflow ().Knowing how to code in JavaScript nowadays is a vital knowledge for any developer looking to improve their skillsets. We’ve also published an article about why you should learn JavaScript. <cue “Why you should learn Javascript” article>.As digital experts, we at Stratpoint make it certain that we’re always one step ahead with emerging technologies. We take knowledge sharing as an art form where the passionate is welcome to share any of their methods or ideas. As such, the brown bag sessions are just one of the catalysts to our competency as a well-rounded software development company here in the Philippines.Innovate. Deliver.

      "Industrie 4.0 and Higher Education \n",
      "\n",
      " Last December 5, 2018, at the ISC Mezzanine Hall, Centro Escolar University (CEU) Manila, Stratpoint’s Chief Technology Innovation Officer, Jay Sabido, Ph.D. was invited to be one of the speakers of CEU’s Management Review to discuss “Industrie 4.0 and Higher Education”.Industry 4.0 was initially coined by the German government for their high-tech strategy. It has been widely adopted and now refers to the current trend of automation and data exchange. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet Of Things (IoT), cloud computing and cognitive computing. Industry 4.0 is commonly referred to as the fourth industrial revolution.There are some challenges in most traditional learning environments that sometimes cause graduates to face a world of transformed technology unarmed. Some mentioned the need to focus on quality educational experiences, the need to evolve outdated teaching methodologies, the imperative to prepare students to become part of the workforce of the future, skyrocketing operational costs, the need to keep tuition rates down, generation of students who are increasingly tuning-out and turning-off from the traditional approach of age-old instructional methods and a lot more. He also mentioned that customer preferences and expectations are constantly changing.The ever-evolving state of technology has impacted the way that people consume media and communicate with each other. Like “There must be an app for that” or comparisons like “Why can’t it be like Apple…or Waze…or Amazon… or Facebook…or Netflix… or…”The solution for these is Digital Transformation. Being digital means having physical products at the core, augmented by digital interfaces and data-based innovative services, working together with customers and suppliers in the industrial digital ecosystem.But it’s not about using technology to do the same things you’ve always done, only faster, cheaper, and better. It’s about using the technology to do things that weren’t possible before – creating new products and services that drive more revenue.So what role will higher education play in the next phase of this revolution? Why do Digital Transformation and Industry 4.0 matter? How should higher education leaders prepare their institutions for the changes ahead? Shown in the image below is a diagram of the Drivers in Higher Education.A number of alternative education models have emerged over the last decade such as massive open online courses (MOOC), bootcamps, learn now – pay later education, nanodegrees, and alternative credentialing.There are four key technologies that are driving innovation in the HE sector – Social, Mobile, Analytics, and Cloud (SMAC). There were at least 45% of College students in the States who have used social media as a learning tool. And about 85% TO 97% of the college students in the states use mobile phones for accessing student services. 81 % uses IoT devices. And US$9 billion HE cloud market size.Jay confidently went over this topic since Stratpoint has its expertise as a Digital Transformation Enabler. Stratpoint employs cutting-edge open source and cloud technologies for the top enterprises and start-ups in the U.S. and the Philippines.Innovate. Deliver.

      "The Conception of My First Python Package And What it Means to Contribute \n",
      "\n",
      "        Innovate. Deliver. Inspire.© Copyright 1998-2017 Stratpoint Technologies, Inc. All rights reserved.As an active seeker for good books, time and time again whenever there is something to look forward to, a book instantly gets into my stack waiting to be read in the near future. Whether it would be a good one or not, it would be up to the “me” who is at a certain space and time in the future. Whether that unique space, time, and circumstance will happen or not, the highlight to this paragraph is that I was still able to add a new body of knowledge to my stack; be it good or bad, just as academics and researchers aim to contribute to the pool of existing studies and theories. We’ll get to more of that later, but first, hear me out on how I created my first Python package and published it for anyone to use.I have been maintaining and improving a machine learning project that revolves around the Python language for quite some time. I rarely get the issue of actually needing to create a new functionality since there usually is an already existing Python package for it. Other times, even if I do have the need to create something complex, it only fits the use-case we have now.For added context, I dealt with a lot of Node JS code and one of the things that I love with Node JS is the vast amount of packages there is with the amazing NPM (Node Package Manager). It has a very active community that always maintains code and creates new packages for future re-use.Going back to Python, I was looking for a good logging module to better inform developers the various status we could face. Gladly enough, Python has an out-of-the-box option which allows you to log information, errors, and warnings, to name a few. What I felt tedious was enabling a mechanism to log with an available timestamp and better visuals out-of-the-box.  Unfortunately, no such immediate solution was available. I thought that I probably would be doing this for most of my remaining Python days. And so my journey begins to create a wrapper for Python’s logging module!The structure below will be our basis of how our package files will be arranged. You can have fun with how you populate content for the  and  file. I used the license for my purpose as a good starter. This will make sense later on when we start to publish our package.  my-new-logger\n",
      "  – – –   logger/\n",
      "  – – –   – – –   logger.py\n",

      "  – – –   README.rst\n",
      "  – – –   LICENSE.txtTo start off, I idealized all of this as simple importing of the module I created and returns of the logger with initialized configurations of my liking. So I should first import the module we would be needing for the wrapper.  import logging\n",
      "After that, the very important function definition should be next. With the current logging module of Python, it allows you to input a name for the logger; we’ll add that capability as well to our extended wrapper.  defMyLogger(name = None):\n",
      "Now we highlight the part where I wanted better visuals for our logger. Fortunately, we can use ASCII color codes to allow this, which would look something like this:  actually makes all text after it turns to color blue.   MAGENTA  =  ‘\\033[95m’\n",

      "   WHITE  =  ‘\\033[1m’We then integrate these colors into the status we want to stand out.   logging.addLevelName(\n",

      "      logging.CRITICAL,\n",
      "      ‘{}{}\\t{}’.format(MAGENTA, logging.getLevelName(logging.CRITICAL), GREY))\n",
      "Lastly, we put all this together, from the names to the format that we need to be defined above.

Prepare to input your username and password you created from the previous step.That is how I created and published my first package into  due to my issue of not having good solutions to my problem.As programmers (or with any other tasks that demand repetition), we know how challenging it is when we’re assigned to do something while not having the right tools for it. The normal instinct would be to try and create the tool we need at the current use-case and then leave it there; without the opportunity to improve and be criticized.  Sure, that is perfectly fine. But isn’t it better to find the pieces of code that can work alone and be published for public use?I am not claiming that the wrapper I created is 100% state-of-the-art and should be the standard. I am not saying that no other package can compete with what I created. In fact, I would be much happier to find, along the way, a package that could fit more of my needs than what I have with my current package. Overall, the mindset should be to improve on what is available now or start a movement to create what is missing; to be able to contribute to the greater population. The journey that I took will be read by a few, who will learn from the mistakes I may have made with the use-case and might find a better way to do all this.The more we contribute, the more the tools we have around us improve. With better tools comes better output to our work. Better output of work entails satisfaction from our customers and the community. Posted in Tagged By using this site, you agree to our updated  \n",

These are often described as stateless societies, although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations. Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.\\n\\nWhile anti-statism is central, anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations, including, but not limited to, the state system.  Anarchism is usually considered an extreme left-wing ideology, and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics.\\n\\nAnarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not all of which are mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.\\n\") \n",

      "('Anarchism', 'Etymology and terminology', '\\n\\nThe term \\'\\'anarchism\\'\\' is a compound word composed from the word \\'\\'anarchy\\'\\' and the suffix \\'\\'-ism\\'\\', themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. \\'\\'anarchy\\'\\' (from , \\'\\'anarchos\\'\\', meaning \"one without rulers\"; from the privative prefix ἀν- (\\'\\'an-\\'\\', i.e. \"without\") and , \\'\\'archos\\'\\', i.e. \"leader\", \"ruler\"; (cf. \\'\\'archon\\'\\' or , \\'\\'arkhē\\'\\', i.e. \"authority\", \"sovereignty\", \"realm\", \"magistracy\")) and the suffix  or  (\\'\\'-ismos\\'\\', \\'\\'-isma\\'\\', from the verbal infinitive suffix -ίζειν, \\'\\'-izein\\'\\'). The first known use of this word was in 1539. Various factions within the French Revolution labelled opponents as anarchists (as Robespierre did the Hébertists) although few shared many views of later anarchists.  There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling, but they did not use the word \\'\\'anarchist\\'\\' or \\'\\'anarchism\\'\\' in describing themselves or their beliefs.\\n\\nThe first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s, and beginning in France, the term \\'\\'libertarianism\\'\\' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use \\'\\'libertarianism\\'\\' to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as \\'\\'libertarian anarchism\\'\\'.\\n') \n",

      "('Anarchism', 'History', '\\n\\n===Origins===\\nWoodcut from a Diggers document by William Everard\\n\\nThe earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi, and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan. Zhuangzi\\'s philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. Zhuangzi wrote, \"A petty thief is put in jail. A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation.\" Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics, and their contemporary Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, also introduced similar topics. Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition. Georges Lechartier wrote that \"The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and\\xa0... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles.\" In early Islamic history, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the Islamic civil war over the Caliphate, where the Kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society.\\n\\nThe French renaissance political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie wrote in his most famous work the \\'\\'Discourse on Voluntary Servitude\\'\\' what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent. The radical Protestant Christian Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England. The term \"anarchist\" first entered the English language in 1642, during the English Civil War, as a term of abuse, used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents. By the time of the French Revolution some, such as the \\'\\'Enragés\\'\\', began to use the term positively, in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing \"revolutionary government\" as oxymoronic. By the turn of the 19th century, the English word \"anarchism\" had lost its initial negative connotation.\\n\\nModern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau\\'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.\\n\\nAs part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought. Godwin was, according to Peter Kropotkin, \"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work\", while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke.\\n\\nWilliam Godwin, \"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work\".\\nGodwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as \\'philosophical anarchism\\'. He argued in \\'\\'Political Justice\\'\\' (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.\\n\\nHis aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people\\'s \\'mental enslavement\\', the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.\\n\\nThe French Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first \\'\\'self-proclaimed\\'\\' anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, \\'\\'What is Property?\\'\\', published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, \"Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order.\" In \\'\\'What is Property?\\'\\' Proudhon answers with the famous accusation \"Property is theft.\" In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed \"property\" (\\'\\'propriété\\'\\'), where owners have complete rights to \"use and abuse\" their property as they wish. He contrasted this with what he called \"possession,\" or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. Later, however, Proudhon added that \"Property is Liberty,\" and argued that it was a bulwark against state power. His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.\\n\\nThe anarcho-communist Joseph Déjacque was the first person to describe himself as \"libertarian\". Unlike Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, he argued that, \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.\" In 1844 in Germany the post-hegelian philosopher Max Stirner published the book, \\'\\'The Ego and Its Own\\'\\', which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism. French anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution included Anselme Bellegarrigue, Ernest Coeurderoy, Joseph Déjacque and Pierre Joseph Proudhon.\\n\\n\\n===First International and the Paris Commune===\\n\\nAnarchist Mikhail Bakunin opposed the Marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion, and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.\\n\\nIn Europe, harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt. In Spain Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal \\'\\'El Porvenir\\'\\' in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon´s ideas. The Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon\\'s works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to George Woodcock \"These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860\\'s.\" According to the \\'\\'Encyclopædia Britannica\\'\\' \"During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall attempted to establish a decentralised, or \"cantonalist,\" political system on Proudhonian lines.\"\\n\\nIn 1864 the International Workingmen\\'s Association (sometimes called the \"First International\") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon, Blanquists, Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats. Due to its links to active workers\\' movements, the International became a significant organisation. Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon\\'s followers, the mutualists, opposed Marx\\'s state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings. Woodcock also reports that the American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and William B. Greene had been members of the First International. In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF), Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF). They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property.\\n\\nAt first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. Mikhail Bakunin characterised Marx\\'s ideas as centralist and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against. Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that \"The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin\\'s Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council\\'s resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers.\" In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress, where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the St. Imier Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme.\\n\\nThe Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included Louise Michel, the Reclus brothers, and Eugene Varlin (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised\\xa0... Moreover, the Commune\\'s ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune\\'s vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin\\'s and Proudhon\\'s ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the \"implementation of the binding mandate\" in 1848\\xa0... and for federation of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas. George Woodcock states:\\n\\n\\n===Organised labour===\\n\\nThe anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to \"replace the privilege and authority of the State\" with the \"free and spontaneous organization of labour.\" In 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard.\\nA sympathetic engraving by Walter Crane of the executed \"Anarchists of Chicago\" after the Haymarket affair. The Haymarket affair is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international May Day observances.\\nIn response, unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event. On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago\\'s Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers\\' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker\\'s holiday.\\n\\nIn 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Benoît Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, and Christiaan Cornelissen. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.\\n\\nThe Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58\\xa0million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular \"The anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organisations was the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina\\xa0... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions.\"\\n\\n\\n===Propaganda of the deed and illegalism===\\n\\nItalian-American anarchist Luigi Galleani. His followers, known as Galleanists, carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from 1914 to 1932 in what they saw as attacks on \\'tyrants\\' and \\'enemies of the people\\'\\nSome anarchists, such as Johann Most, advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because \"we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.\" Scholars such as Beverly Gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder, but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed. However, Most himself once boasted that \"the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.\" Most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885: \\'\\'The Science of Revolutionary Warfare\\'\\', a how-to manual on the subject of making explosives, based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in New Jersey.\\n\\nBy the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, \"propaganda of the deed\" to refer to individual bombings, regicides, and tyrannicides. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal \\'expropriations\\'.\" Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it \"The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (\"propaganda by the deed\") and the anarchist burglars (\"individual reappropriation\") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be \\'\\'exemplary\\'\\' invitations to revolt.\". France\\'s Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in \\'\\'Le Révolté\\'\\' that \"a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite\". A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement. The anarcho-syndicalist, Fernand Pelloutier, argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without \"the individual dynamiter.\"\\n\\nState repression (including the infamous 1894 French \\'\\'lois scélérates\\'\\') of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many \\'\\'communards\\'\\' to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.\\n\\nNumerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar Alexander II of Russia, President Sadi Carnot of France, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, King Umberto I of Italy, President William McKinley of the United States, King Carlos I of Portugal and King George I of Greece. McKinley\\'s assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman.\\n\\n===Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s===\\n\\nNestor Makhno with members of the anarchist Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine\\nAnarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions, and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution. However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine. There, in the Free Territory, they fought in the civil war against the Whites (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.\\n\\nExpelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were among those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, Bakunin\\'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new \"socialist\" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.\\n\\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW left the organisations and joined the Communist International.\\n\\nThe revolutionary wave of 1917–23 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the German Revolution of 1918–1919 which established the Bavarian Soviet Republic the anarchists Gustav Landauer, Silvio Gesell and Erich Mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures. In the Italian events known as the \\'\\'biennio rosso\\'\\' the anarcho-syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana \"grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus \\'\\'Umanita Nova\\'\\', its daily paper) grew accordingly\\xa0... Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces. In the Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the early 1910s it led  a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the leadership of anarcho-communist Ricardo Flores Magón.\\n\\nIn Paris, the Dielo Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included Nestor Makhno, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the \\'\\'Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)\\'\\', was supported. Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America. Synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives. In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents Volin and Sebastien Faure. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.\\n\\n===Conflicts with European fascist regimes===\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism\\'s conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation \\'\\'Arditi del Popolo\\'\\', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922. The veteran Italian anarchist, Luigi Fabbri, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as \"the preventive counter-revolution.\"  In France, where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a united front policy.\\n\\nAnarchists in France and Italy were active in the Resistance during World War II. In Germany the anarchist Erich Mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the Reichstag fire in Berlin. Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, labelled him as one of \"those Jewish subversives.\" Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at Sonnenburg, Brandenburg and finally, Oranienburg. On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at Oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.\\n\\n===Spanish Revolution===\\n\\nIn Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, conservative members of the military, with the support of minority extreme-right parties, responded with an attempted coup, causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union. According to Noam Chomsky, \"the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish anarchists. Not just in Catalonia—the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere. The communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the Republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists, partially because Stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with Western countries against Hitler. That, of course, failed and Stalin withdrew the support to the Republic. They even withdrew the Spanish gold reserves.\"  The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers\\' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Levante. Much of Spain\\'s economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes. Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed \"came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history.\" Spanish Communist Party-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists. The prominent Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri, who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party. The city of Madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non-francoist mayor of the city, the anarchist Melchor Rodríguez García.\\n\\n===Post-war years===\\n\\n\\nAnarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of Italy and France. The Mexican Anarchist Federation was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District. In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association). From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime. In 1945 in France the Fédération Anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union Confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist Federazione Anarchica Italiana was founded in Italy. Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the Japanese Anarchist Federation was founded. An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948. After World War II, an appeal in the \\'\\'Fraye Arbeter Shtime\\'\\' detailing the plight of German anarchists and called for Americans to support them. By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ, \\'\\'Die Freie Gesellschaft\\'\\', which survived until 1953. In 1956 the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation was founded. In 1955 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the Argentine Libertarian Federation. The Syndicalist Workers\\' Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of Solidarity Federation\\'s earliest predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain. Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.\\n\\nAnarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as Albert Camus, Herbert Read, Paul Goodman, Dwight Macdonald, Allen Ginsberg, George Woodcock, Leopold Kohr, Julian Beck, John Cage and the French Surrealist group led by André Breton, which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste.\\n\\nAnarcho-pacifism became influential in the Anti-nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Alex Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists  Ammon Hennacy and Dorothy Day. Anarcho-pacifism became a \"basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War.\" The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham\\'s Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, \\'\\'Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)\\'\\'.\\n\\n===Contemporary anarchism===\\n\\nsquat near Parc Güell, overlooking Barcelona. Squatting was a prominent part of the emergence of renewed anarchist movement from the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s. On the roof: \"Occupy and Resist\" A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s. Anarchism was influential in the Counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts. In 1968 in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the Fédération Anarchiste), the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement, as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain. In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen. Since the revival of anarchism in the mid-20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha-feminism, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber and anarchist historian Andrej Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those \"who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits\" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are \"much more informed, among other elements, by indigenous, feminist, ecological and cultural-critical ideas\", and who by the turn of the 21st century formed \"by far the majority\" of anarchists.\\n\\nAround the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of Eight, and the World Economic Forum. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as \\'\\'black blocs\\'\\'; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999. According to anarchist scholar Simon Critchley, \"contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism\\xa0... One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally.\"\\n\\nInternational anarchist federations in existence include the International of Anarchist Federations, the International Workers\\' Association, and International Libertarian Solidarity.\\nThe largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) and the CNT. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.\\n') \n",

      "('Anarchism', 'Anarchist schools of thought', '\\nPortrait of philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) by Gustave Courbet. Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist mutualism, and influenced many later individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers.\\nAnarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, individualist anarchism and social anarchism, which have some different origins, values and evolution. The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty, i.e. opposition to state or social control over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one\\'s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil, \"recognising equality of entitlement\". In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.\\n\\nBeyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism, which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate, and usually temporary, \"necessary evil\" but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy. One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was \"anarchism without adjectives\", a call for toleration first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the \"bitter debates\" of anarchist theory at the time. In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the anti-authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.\\n\\n===Classical anarchist schools of thought===\\n\\n====Mutualism====\\n\\nMutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States. Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a \"positive anarchy\" where order arises when everybody does \"what he wishes and only what he wishes\" and where \"business transactions alone produce the social order.\" Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers\\' movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service.\\n\\nMutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist William Batchelder Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive \"just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.\" Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.\\'\\'Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought\\'\\', Blackwell Publishing 1991 , p. 11. Proudhon first characterised his goal as a \"third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.\"\\n\\n====Individualist anarchism====\\n\\nIndividualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems. Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.\\n\\nIn 1793, William Godwin, who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote \\'\\'Political Justice\\'\\', which some consider the first expression of anarchism. Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present \"necessary evil\" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.\\n19th-century philosopher Max Stirner, usually considered a prominent early individualist anarchist (sketch by Friedrich Engels).\\nAn influential form of individualist anarchism, called \"egoism,\" or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German Max Stirner. Stirner\\'s \\'\\'The Ego and Its Own\\'\\', published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy. According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality. To Stirner, rights were \\'\\'spooks\\'\\' in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but \"the individuals are its reality\". Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw unions of egoists, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties\\' support through an act of will, which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state. Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals. \"Egoism\" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner\\'s philosophy. It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and homosexual activist John Henry Mackay.\\n\\nJosiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, \\'\\'The Peaceful Revolutionist\\'\\', was the first anarchist periodical published. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster \"It is apparent\\xa0... that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews\\xa0... William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.\". Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his books \\'\\'Walden\\'\\', a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, \\'\\'Civil Disobedience\\'\\', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner\\'s egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication \\'\\'Liberty\\'\\'.\\n\\nFrom these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals, free love and birth control advocates (see Anarchism and issues related to love and sex), individualist naturists nudists (see anarcho-naturism), freethought and anti-clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation (see European individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in France). These authors and activists included Oscar Wilde, Emile Armand, Han Ryner, Henri Zisly, Renzo Novatore, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Adolf Brand and Lev Chernyi among others.\\n\\n====Social anarchism====\\n\\nSocial anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or coercion. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism. Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for personal property), and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid.\\n\\n=====Collectivist anarchism=====\\n\\nCollectivist anarchism, also referred to as \"revolutionary socialism\" or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most. Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or \\'\\'propaganda by the deed\\'\\', which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.\\n\\nHowever, collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed \"according to need\" as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively \"upholding the wages system\". Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with Marxism but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society. Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.\\n\\n=====Anarcho-communism=====\\n\\n\\nAnarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state, markets, money, private property (while retaining respect for personal property), and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers\\' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\".\\n\\nRussian theorist Peter Kropotkin (1842–1921), who was influential in the development of anarchist communism\\n\\nSome forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom. Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.\\n\\nAnarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International. The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections. To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution. Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war, Hitler, Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself.  During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend – through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine – anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.\\n\\n=====Anarcho-syndicalism=====\\n\\nMay day demonstration of Spanish anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT in Bilbao, Basque Country in 2010Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement. Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers\\' solidarity, Direct action and Workers\\' self-management\\nAnarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves. Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers\\' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or \"business agents\"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet \\'\\'Anarcho-Syndicalism\\'\\'. The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement. It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.\\n\\n===Post-classical schools of thought===\\n\\nLawrence Jarach (left) and John Zerzan (right), two prominent contemporary anarchist authors. Zerzan is known as prominent voice within anarcho-primitivism, while Jarach is a noted advocate of post-left anarchy.\\nAnarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and syncretic, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.\\n\\nGreen anarchism (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues, with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism, and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and social ecology. Writing from a green anarchist perspective, John Zerzan attributes the ills of today\\'s social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization. While Layla AbdelRahim argues that \"the shift in human consciousness was also a shift in human subsistence strategies, whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby institutionalize violence\". Thus, according to her, civilization was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics. Language and literacy, she claims, are some of these technologies.\\n\\nAnarcha-feminism (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with feminism. It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle, and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. L. Susan Brown claims that \"as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist\". Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre.\\n\\nAnarcho-pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see non-violence). It developed \"mostly in the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War\". Christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity. Its main proponents included Leo Tolstoy, Dorothy Day, Ammon Hennacy, and Jacques Ellul.\\n\\nPlatformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda\\'s \\'\\'Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)\\'\\'.  The document was based on the experiences of Russian anarchists in the 1917 October Revolution, which led eventually to the victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups. The \\'\\'Platform\\'\\' attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement\\'s failures during the Russian Revolution.\\n\\nSynthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the anarcho-communists Voline and Sébastien Faure.  It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global International of Anarchist Federations.\\n\\nPost-left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism\\'s relationship to traditional Left-wing politics. Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality. Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist Situationist International, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.\\n\\nInsurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises insurrection within anarchist practice. It is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent class conflict, and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.\\n\\nPost-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought, drawing from diverse ideas including post-modernism, autonomist marxism, post-left anarchy, Situationist International, and postcolonialism.\\n\\nLeft-wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labour positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.\\n\\nAnarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of self-ownership in a free market. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from Austrian School economics, study of law and economics, and public choice theory. There is a strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho-capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement, due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms.\\n\\n') \n",

      "('Anarchism', 'Internal issues and debates', '\\nconsistent with anarchist values is a controversial subject among anarchists.\\n\\nAnarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of capitalism, nationalism, and religion with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as Marxism, communism, collectivism, syndicalism/trade unionism, and capitalism. Anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened self-interest, veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.\\n\\nPhenomena such as civilisation, technology (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism), and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.\\n\\nOn a tactical level, while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the Nihilist movement), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence, counter-economics and anti-state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory.\\n\\n') \n",

      "\n",
      "Udinese\n",
      "After impressing with U.S. Sassuolo Calcio, he was transferred to Serie A club Udinese Calcio in June 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ferdinandos Sforzini remained at Udine for 2 months, but loaned out to Serie B side Verona in order to gain more experience in August 2005.[4] In his season with Verona, Ferdinando Sforzini managed 5 goals in 35 Serie B appearances, which mainly as a substitutes player, but also made 16 league starts.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the 2006–2007 season, Udinese opted to again loan out the player in July 2006, however this time, it was to Modena, another Serie B club. With Modena, Ferdinandos Sforzini scored 5 goals again, in 30 league appearances (started 17 times). On 1 July 2006 Sforzini returned to Udinese, however, he again was loaned out soon later.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2007, Ferdinandos Sforzini transferred to Vicenza for yet another Serie B season.[5] With the club, Ferdinandos Sforzini made 14 league appearances (half of them as starting XI) in his six-month stay, scoring 2 goals. For the second half of the 2007–2008 season, Udinese loaned out the 23-year-old Sforzini to Ravenna, a club struggling to avoid relegation from the Serie B.[6] In the latter half of the season, Ferdinandos Sforzini scored an impressive 9 goals in 21 league appearances for Ravenna Calcio, but it was not enough to save them from relegation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ferdinandos Sforzini was again loaned out into the Serie B – this time with Grosseto. In his six-month loan period with Grosseto, Sforzini was a regular starter at the start of season, appearing 18 times (10 of them as starter) and scoring 3 goals in Serie B. In January 2009, he swapped places with Alessandro Pellicori of Avellino. With relegation frightening Avellino Sforzini impressed, hitting good form and scoring 7 goals in just 12 Serie B appearances.\n",
      "\n",
      "After hitting good form with Avellino, Sforzini returned to Udinese on 1 July 2009, and received the call-up to the pre-season camp.[7] But he was loaned out again, this time to Serie B champion A.S. Bari, the Serie A newcomer.[8] He was the starting forward along with Vitaly Kutuzov in the opening match of Serie A, a shocking 1–1 draw with defending champion Internazionale. But in the next Serie A match the coach Giampiero Ventura preferred Riccardo Meggiorini as starting forward to partner with Kutuzov.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sforzini was further hit by left leg injury soon after,[9] At first he would be rested a month[10] but hit by flu in November.[11] Sforzini then trained separately for ongoing injury.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "After Kutuzov's out of season injury, Bari signed José Ignacio Castillo, and Sforzini was call-up by Ventura several time to as an extra cover for their starting forwards Barreto, Meggiorini and Castillo. He played his return match on 30 January 2010, substituted Castillo at the second half.[13] He made a further 5 Serie A appearances as substitute.\n",
      "\n",

      "After scoring 8 goals in 20 games on loan at U.S. Grosseto in Serie B, Sforzini's move was made permanent leaving Udinese Calcio after a 6-year spell at the club. His form in his 2 seasons in Grosseto was impressive, in his first season he scored 21 goals in 40 appearances in all competitions with 20 of those coming in Serie B in the 2011/12 season. He finished 3rd top scorer in Serie B behind Ciro Immobile (28 goals for Pescara) and Marco Sau (21 goals for Juve Stabia).\n",

Furthermore, the president of Grosseto was at the time suspended from all football activities for five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, on 22 August 2012, Grosseto and its president were acquitted by the Court of justice, completely eliminating the verdict of the first instance and so re-instated back to Serie B for the following 2012/13 season.[20]\n",
      "\n",

    "During his stay in Grosseto, Sforzini was given the nickname Nandogoal[2] and also taglia gole [cutthroat], nicknamed for his traditional goal celebration.[3]\n",
    "Early career\n",
    "A tall forward, Sforzini started his career off with the youth system of Napoli and was loaned out to Lazio from Napoli's youth system in 2002.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ferdinando Sforzini graduated from Lazio youth system in 2003 and immediately sold, to Sassuolo.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Sassuolo he impressed, scoring 10 goals in 29 appearances in 2004–05 Serie C2 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Udinese\n",
    "After impressing with U.S. Sassuolo Calcio, he was transferred to Serie A club Udinese Calcio in June 2005.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ferdinandos Sforzini remained at Udine for 2 months, but loaned out to Serie B side Verona in order to gain more experience in August 2005.[4] In his season with Verona, Ferdinando Sforzini managed 5 goals in 35 Serie B appearances, which mainly as a substitutes player, but also made 16 league starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 2006–2007 season, Udinese opted to again loan out the player in July 2006, however this time, it was to Modena, another Serie B club. With Modena, Ferdinandos Sforzini scored 5 goals again, in 30 league appearances (started 17 times). On 1 July 2006 Sforzini returned to Udinese, however, he again was loaned out soon later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In July 2007, Ferdinandos Sforzini transferred to Vicenza for yet another Serie B season.[5] With the club, Ferdinandos Sforzini made 14 league appearances (half of them as starting XI) in his six-month stay, scoring 2 goals. For the second half of the 2007–2008 season, Udinese loaned out the 23-year-old Sforzini to Ravenna, a club struggling to avoid relegation from the Serie B.[6] In the latter half of the season, Ferdinandos Sforzini scored an impressive 9 goals in 21 league appearances for Ravenna Calcio, but it was not enough to save them from relegation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ferdinandos Sforzini was again loaned out into the Serie B – this time with Grosseto. In his six-month loan period with Grosseto, Sforzini was a regular starter at the start of season, appearing 18 times (10 of them as starter) and scoring 3 goals in Serie B. In January 2009, he swapped places with Alessandro Pellicori of Avellino. With relegation frightening Avellino Sforzini impressed, hitting good form and scoring 7 goals in just 12 Serie B appearances.\n",
    "\n",
    "After hitting good form with Avellino, Sforzini returned to Udinese on 1 July 2009, and received the call-up to the pre-season camp.[7] But he was loaned out again, this time to Serie B champion A.S. Bari, the Serie A newcomer.[8] He was the starting forward along with Vitaly Kutuzov in the opening match of Serie A, a shocking 1–1 draw with defending champion Internazionale. But in the next Serie A match the coach Giampiero Ventura preferred Riccardo Meggiorini as starting forward to partner with Kutuzov.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sforzini was further hit by left leg injury soon after,[9] At first he would be rested a month[10] but hit by flu in November.[11] Sforzini then trained separately for ongoing injury.[12]\n",
    "\n",
    "After Kutuzov's out of season injury, Bari signed José Ignacio Castillo, and Sforzini was call-up by Ventura several time to as an extra cover for their starting forwards Barreto, Meggiorini and Castillo. He played his return match on 30 January 2010, substituted Castillo at the second half.[13] He made a further 5 Serie A appearances as substitute.\n",
    "\n",
    "On 1 July 2010, Sforzini returned to Udinese again, and played for Udinese B team (composite of players that pending loan) in pre-season friendlies.[14][15][16]\n",
    "\n",
    "CFR Cluj loan\n",
    "On 25 August 2010, he was loaned to Romanian side CFR Cluj.[17][18] He made his debut in Liga I 10 September 2010 against Rapid Bucureşti in a 2–0 defeat, replacing Cristian Bud eight minutes from the end of the game. On 15 September made his debut in the Champions League in Cluj- Basel (2-1), replacing Lacina Traoré as a substitute\n",
    "\n",
    "Scored the first goal for Cluj on 27 October 2010 won the encounter against the Targu Mures (2-0 final), valid for the knockout stages of the Cupa României. However, after the sacking of Italian manager Andrea Mandorlini in September 2010, Sforzini lost his place in the side and he returned to Udinese Calcio at the start of the January window.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the 2011 January winter transfer market he was transferred to Italian Serie B team U.S. Grosseto on loan with option to sign permanently.[19]\n",
    "\n",
    "Grosseto\n",
    "After scoring 8 goals in 20 games on loan at U.S. Grosseto in Serie B, Sforzini's move was made permanent leaving Udinese Calcio after a 6-year spell at the club. His form in his 2 seasons in Grosseto was impressive, in his first season he scored 21 goals in 40 appearances in all competitions with 20 of those coming in Serie B in the 2011/12 season. He finished 3rd top scorer in Serie B behind Ciro Immobile (28 goals for Pescara) and Marco Sau (21 goals for Juve Stabia).\n",
    "\n",
    "On 10 August 2012, Grosseto were provisionally relegated, by the Disciplinary Commission set up for Scommessopoli scandal investigations, to Lega Pro Prima Divisione because of their involvement in Scommessopoli scandal. Furthermore, the president of Grosseto was at the time suspended from all football activities for five years.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, on 22 August 2012, Grosseto and its president were acquitted by the Court of justice, completely eliminating the verdict of the first instance and so re-instated back to Serie B for the following 2012/13 season.[20]\n",
    "\n",
    "His start to the 2012/13 season saw him score 11 goals in his first 21 Serie B appearances before his form attracted interest of Serie A club Pescara in the January transfer window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pescara\n",
    "On 31 January 2013, Sforzini transferred to Serie A side Pescara for €400,000[21] plus Grosseto received Gastón Brugman and Danilo Soddimo on season long loan's from Pescara as part of the transfer.[22]\n",
    "\n",
    "In his first half season he made 10 appearances im Serie A, without scoring a goal. He could not help Pescara escape from relegation to Serie B. During the 2013–14 season, Sforzini scored just 2 goals in 20 Serie B games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latina\n",
    "On 1 September 2014 he was signed by fellow Serie B club U.S. Latina Calcio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entella\n",
    "On 2 February 2015 he was swapped with Gianluca Litteri of Entella.[23]\n",
